# MovieSeatBookingSystem

Here I have made a small Movie seat reservation System. In which I am asking the user for his credentials and no. of seats. 
Aftermath throught routing I am taking him to reservation screen. Where he can selest his intrested seats. Have made a check on no. of seats selsction.
Also Before confirming, it will indicate the user the maimum seats he can choose. After confirmation I am redirecting him to main Page storing his information in the table. Used ng-class , ng-show and ng-hide smartly.
